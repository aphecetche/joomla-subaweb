V2.2

- styling a bit the job(s) views
- adding the name of the group on top of the right menu for all groups under "recherche"

V2.0

- using mootools everywhere instead of jQuery, to avoid loading two big JS libraries
- start using a specific LESS file for IE (as a temporary measure until we find a better way, or for ever if we don't)

V1.1

- CSS Correcting labels not displaying correctly for "new seminar" form for seminar type (spécialisé, généraliste, ita)
 where only the first radio box was visible

- JS correcting the expanded navigation, which were auto-closing after a resize to small size (where
 it is removed) and then back to "normal" size (where it was added back but events were not properly handled)
